CBMEN ENCODERS Evaluation Branch
================================

This branch contains studies (parametrized tests which are
based on a test generation/running framework) and tests (which
are non-parametrized).

Tests
=====

These tests are located inside the tests/ directory.
To run a specific test, please go inside its folder and
follow appropriate instructions.

Studies
=======

This branch contains the evaluation framework (see directory
studies/framework) which uses NRL's CORE/EMANE 4.3 (a slightly
modified version included as source code) together with Linux
Containers to run automated tests and parameter studies. The framework
includes a Python-based test script generator that uses BonnMotion
(Java-based scenario generator) as a component.

See the docs directory for further documentation.
A two-slide overview can be found under docs/demo_slides/slides.pdf.

Various sample studies can be found in the studies directory. Most
subdirectories correspond to paramter studies. All studies assume that
Haggle with the approriate CBMEN features has been built and installed
on the Linux host. We have use Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 in our tests.

The typical sequence to run those studies (e.g. milcom-dissemination) is ... 

cd studies/framework/lxc/bin
./clean.sh milcom-dissemination
./generate.sh milcom-dissemination
./generate_test_list.sh milcom-dissemination
./run.sh milcom-dissemination

To regenerate the test scripts, e.g. after modifying test_spec.json,
you may want to delete the Testsuite directory.

Similarly, it is advisable to remove the TestOutput directory
before rerunning if the old reports and logs are not needed anymore.
