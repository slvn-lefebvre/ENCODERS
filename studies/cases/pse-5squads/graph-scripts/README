These scripts will generate the graphs for the pse scenario.

1. Rename your TestOutput directory to correspond to the filename you want for the resulting
   graph (e.g. 140408-1304-phase2-basic-udissemination-milcom).

2. cd into that directory.

3. Run make_graphs.sh. It will rename the log directories, generate graphs, and give them the same
   name as the current working directory, with a .eps extension.
