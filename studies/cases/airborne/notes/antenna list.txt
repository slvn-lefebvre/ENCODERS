Antenna master list:

On sattelite:
  - Ground link antenna, facing down, 0.8 degree angle
  - Adjacent cluster link, omnidirectional, shorter range (say 50km or however far apart satellite clusters are)

On AWACs:
  - Static link to other AWACS
  - 200 nautical mile range to jets
  - To sattelite: antenna facing up, 0.8 degrees

On Jets:
  - To sattelite: antenna facing up, 0.8 degrees
  - Can jets actually transmit? Document mentions something about receive only mode or low tx power. Low tx power would suggest sending to sattelite might not be possible.
  - 200 nautical mile range to AWACs

On Surface ship: (80nmi behind AWACs)
  - connected to AWACS/ground
On Ground: (1000nmi behind surface ship)
  - connected to AWACs/ship
