This document describes the manual tests for AlphaDIRECT++, which we refer
to as DIRECT below.

dense/* : contains dense networks useful for stress tests.

mobile1/* : contains a mobile microbenchmark that demonstrates how DIRECT
and Prophet handle simple mobility. In particular, it is a pathological
case for Prophet's encounter based approach. This was presented in the
September 2012 presentation (briefing).

mobile2/* : contains a microbenchmark where two nodes swap positions. This
scenario is useful for microbenchmarking the different content dissemination
strategies. This scenario was in the September 2012 powerpoint presentation.

mobile3/* : contains message ferrying examples demonstrating the differences
between proactive replication via flooding, and DIRECT.
