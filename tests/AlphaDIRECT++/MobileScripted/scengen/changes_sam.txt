I've update scengen (MobileScripted/scengen) so that you can now specify
the seed in "scen-spec" through the global ("seed = X") attribute.
This will let us generate scen files in a repeatable way (as opposed to
scengen generating a new one each time you call it, using the current
time as a seed). 

Also, I added a flag ("print_dest_comments = 1") that will print out the velocity
and pause time for each movement in a comment (i.e. ## velocity: X, pause time: Y).
This way we can compute the average/std pause time and velocities easily from the
scen file.
