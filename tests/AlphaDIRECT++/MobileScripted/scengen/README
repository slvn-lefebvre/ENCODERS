1. Compiling the Scenario Generator

Simply do a "make" to compile. Makefile can be modified if needed.

2. Running the Scenario Generator

Run "./scengen" to generate scenarios. 

The program takes two inputs. One is "model-spec", which contains the
default parameters, and normally does not need to be changed. If changes
are needed, it has to be done with caution. The other input, scenario
specification is the file "scen-spec", which describes the scenario
needed.

3. Viewing the scenario

The "ad-hockey" program, initially developed for the wireless extention to 
NS-2 by CMU, can be used to view the mobility scenario without running any 
simulations. The original ad-hockey is available at:
    http://www.monarch.cs.cmu.edu/cmu-ns.html

However, the ad-hockey needs some slight modifications before it can not 
display the scenario correctly because of the changes of NS-2 scenario format. 
A modified version of ad-hockey is included in the "./ad-hockey/" directory.

3. The Format of Scenario Specification

Every line of the file "scen-spec" begins with a "#" is a comment and will
not be processed. Also, empty lines are ignored. The file is divided into
sections, each of them begins with the line "[section_name]", and ends
implictly when another section begins. Within each section, each non-empty
is a parameter of that section, which has the form "key = value". The
spacing is not significant.

Each scenario must have a section named "global" or "Global", which
contains global information about the scenario, "area", "start_time" and
"stop_time". A sample global section is given below:

#####################

    [global]
    area = rect(1000,500)
    start_time = 0
    stop_time = 90

#####################

the parameter "area" specifies the simulation area. The "area =
rect(1000,500)" above tells the scenario generator that the simulation
area is a 1000m by 500m rectangle. So far, only rectangle areas are
supported.

Every other sections are treated as specifications of groups of nodes.
Each of the group must contain at least two parameters, "num_nodes" and
"member_model". Other parameters are optional. Examles of these parameters
and their descriptions are as follows:

########################################################

# total number of nodes in this group is 30
    num_nodes = 30

# use random waypoint model to model member nodes
    member_model = Waypoint 

# the member nodes moves in a 300m by 300m rectangle
# default is the same as the entire scenarion
    member_area = rect(300,300)

# the offset of the group relative to the whole scenario is (50, 150)
# default is (0, 0)
    offset = (50, 150)

# use brownian motion model to model the center
# if not specified, center point will not move
    center_model = Brownian

# set the parameter "param" for the member model to be "value"
    member_model.param = value

# set the parameter "param" for the center model to be "value"
    center_model.param = value

# For the last two parameters, the kind of "param" can be specified depends
# on the models used, which can be found in the file "model-spec".

# To let the model generate accelerated movements, use the following:
    center_model.ACC_T = time 
    center_model.ACC_A = acceleration
# or,
    member_model.ACC_T = time 
    member_model.ACC_A = acceleration
# depending on whether the model is applied to the center or the member

########################################################

Sample scenario specification files and the corresponding scenario files 
can be found in directory "./scen/".

4. To Add/Modify Models

If new models are to be added, or existing models need to be modified,
please read the file "MODELS" for details.
