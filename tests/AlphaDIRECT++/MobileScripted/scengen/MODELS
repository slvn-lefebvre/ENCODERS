For compilation and excution of the program, see README for details. This
document here describes how to add new models and how to modify existing
model implementations.

1. To Add a New Model

Suppose you have new mobility model named "MyModel". There are 6 steps to
be done to add it to the scenario generator.

a. Create files mymodel.cc and mymodel.h with the implementation of the model;
b. Modify the Makefile so that the source files are included in compilation;
c. Add an entry to "enum ModelType" in model.h; 
d. Add an entry in the file "model-spec" to specify the default parameters;
e. Add an entry in ModelSpec::createModelByName() in modelspec.cc;
f. Add the line #include "mymodel.h" in modelspec.cc.


2. To Modify an Existing Model

For example, suppose the implementation of the Random Waypoint Model needs 
to be modified, the following steps could be done:

a. Modify the Waypoint section in model-spec if needed;
b. Modify Waypoint::init(...) if the amount or type of the parameters are
   changed in step a;
c. Modify Waypoint::makeMove(...) if needed.

Not all the steps above are needed in all situations.


3. Implemented Mobility Models

The names of the models implemented and their default parameters can be
found in the file "model-spec".
