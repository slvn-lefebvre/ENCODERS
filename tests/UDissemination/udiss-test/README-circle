This test verifies correct contact time for mobility.   It uses 2 nodes, one stationary, and one moving in a circle.   Due to sunstech testing, the estimated contact time will be approximately 19 seconds, and an estimated bandwidth of 700KB/sec transfer rate.

Node n1 publishes data objects of size 100k, every second, for 138 seconds.
Node n2 publishes data objects of size 102k, every second, for 138 seconds.

Neither node n1, nor n2 will subscribe to any content.
During the time in contact, each node will be updated by the other node, of expected contact time.    Initially, the contact time measured will be 0ms.   If a node is a neighbor, with 0ms contact time, it will not have disconnected, and be considered a static node.   As node n2 moves in a circle, it will have a connect time and disconnect time.   During this contact time, both nodes are free to replicate to the other.

To verify correct operation, we have the following pass conditions:
1.   There is, at least, an initial 0ms connection time and 0B/sec bandwidth.
2.   All results, with the exception of one possible intermediate result, will be +-30% of expected values (19000 ms duration, and 700KB/sec).
3.   At most, one non zero, non expected result is allowed.    Since the contact time is dynamic, the initial disconnect may not be within expected tolerance.
4.    At least 5 DO's from n1 must be replicated to n2, and, at least 5 DO's from n2 must be replicated to n1.

Due to the variability of results of the platform, we have set a 30% range for time, bandwidth, and, at least 5 data objects to be replicated from/to each node.

To execute the test:
Make sure the testrunner is set up (see docs/README-testrunner-setup) and the testrunner scripts
for your platform are in your $PATH, then use the commands "generate_test_list.sh ." and "run.sh ."
