This is a test to verify LOCAL is working correctly.

It involves 5 nodes, a source node (S), an intermediate node (I), and 3 destination nodes (D1-D3).

         | D1 |

         | D3 |

The test does the following:
1.  Node I has a very small cache, only capable of holding 3 DO's, at most.
2.  Node I publishes a local Data object
3.  Node S publishes 10 data objects
4.  Nodes D1-D3 subcribe to the content, which Node S publishes.

To verify if it works:
Node I must have the original Data Object it published locally


To execute the test:
Make sure the testrunner is set up (see docs/README-testrunner-setup) and the testrunner scripts
for your platform are in your $PATH, then use the commands "generate_test_list.sh ." and "run.sh ."
