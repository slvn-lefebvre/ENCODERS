Porting Tests from TestRunner-LXC Manually
------------------------------------------

If you only have a Testsuite directory and no test_spec.json from which to
generate a new one, you will have to port your test to work with the Android
testing framework.


*NEW* Automatic Test Conversion
-------------------------------

You may now use the automatic test conversion script, test_convert.py to
convert a testsuite from LXC to Android. Run 'test_convert.py -h' for details.

Manual Test Conversion
----------------------

1. Make a copy of the AndroidTestGenerator/TestTemplate directory.

2. Copy over app.sh, custom_validate.sh, echo_duration.sh, mobile.imn.template,
   mobile.scen, and any config.xml files from the old test.

3. Fill in template information. The following files will need to be edited:

  * echo_num_devices.sh: Replace %%num_devices%% with the number of phones.
  * echo_output_path.sh: Replace %%output_path%% with the directory you want
    test output to be saved in. You can look this up in the original test in
    echo_output_path.sh file. Look for a line that reads:

    ODIR=$(dirname "../../../<test-name>/TestOutput/<test-case>")

    The part in quotes is %%output_path%%.

4. Edit start_up.sh. Copy lines from the start_up.sh in the original test
   directory that look like:

    dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/<filename> bs=1024 count=10 &> /dev/null

  and use them to replace %%dd_string%%. Replace %%push_string%% with corresponding
  lines that read:

    adb_n $NUM_DEVICES "push /tmp/<filename> /data/tmp/<filename>" &> /dev/null

  Where <filename> in the new line matches <filename> in the old line.

5. Edit tear_down.sh. For each dd line in start_up.sh, add a line that reads

    rm /tmp/<filename>

  to tear_down.sh in place of %%rm_string%%.

6. Edit app.sh:
  * Replace every occurrence of "/tmp" with "/data/tmp"
  * Replace "/sbin/ifconfig eth0" with "busybox ifconfig usb0"
  * Replace every occurrence of "mktemp" with "mktemp /data/tmp/temp.XXXX"

7. Edit mobile.imn.template. This is covered in the file README-porting-lxc-to-android-core
