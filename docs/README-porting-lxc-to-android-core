The Simplest Option
-------------------

By far the simplest and most reliable way to get a .imn file that will work with
CORE 4.6 is to make it by hand with the CORE GUI. If, for some reason, this is
undesirable, the following guidelines should help you edit an existing file to
work with the Android testrunner.


Caveat
------

Translating CORE imn files manually is not a well-understood process. Even if
you make the changes listed below, it's not guaranteed that the resulting file
will work properly. You may find that your mobility model does not work, or that
network connectivity is not actually established. In such a case, we reccommend
rebuilding the configuration file from scratch in the CORE GUI, using RJ45 nodes
instead of PC nodes, and mapping n<X> to usb<X-1>.


Porting .imn files for the Android Testrunner
---------------------------------------------

The biggest difference between .imn files for the LXC testrunner and the Android
testrunner is that the network endpoints are USB ports, not Linux containers.
Here is an example node entry for an LXC node:

node n1 {
    type router
    model PC
    network-config {
  hostname n1
  !
  interface eth0
   ip address 10.0.1.20/32
   ipv6 address 2001:1::20/128
  !
    }
    canvas c1
    iconcoords {0.0 0.0}
    labelcoords {0.0 0.0}
    interface-peer {eth0 n31}
    services {DefaultRoute HaggleService}
}

Here is a corresponding entry for an Android node:

node n1 {
    type rj45
    network-config {
  hostname usb0
  !
  model
  !
    }
    canvas c1
    iconcoords {0.0 0.0}
    labelcoords {0.0 0.0}
    interface-peer {0 n31}
}

The key differences are:
  * The change of type from "router" to "rj45"
  * The removal of the "model" attribute
  * The change of "hostname" from "n1" to "usb0". The decrement here is
    important! Node n<X> should be associated with hostname usb<X-1>.
  * The removal of the IP address info from network-config
  * The change in interface-peer from {eth0 n31} to simply {0 n31}


Changing .imn Files from CORE 4.3 to 4.6
----------------------------------------

The most important thing that has changed in CORE 4.6 is the way mobility models
are specified in the .imn file. The wlan section CORE 4.3 imn file looks like:

node n31 {
    type wlan
    network-config {
  hostname wlan1
  !
  interface wireless
   ip address 10.0.1.0/32
   ipv6 2001:1::0/128
  !
  scriptfile
  %%scen_path%%
  !
  mobmodel
  coreapi
  emane_ieee80211abg
  !
    }
    custom-config {
  custom-config-id emane_ieee80211abg
  custom-command {
  ...
  }
    }
    canvas c1
    iconcoords {0.0 0.0}
    labelcoords {0.0 0.0}
    interface-peer {e0 n1}
    ...
}

Note that the script file for the mobility scenario is defined in the
network-config section. Contrast with the same section from a CORE 4.6 file:

node n31 {
    type wlan
    network-config {
  hostname wlan1
  !
  interface wireless
   ip address 10.0.1.0/32
   ipv6 address 2001:1::0/128
  !
  mobmodel
  coreapi
  emane_ieee80211abg
  ns2script
  !
    }
    custom-config {
  custom-config-id emane_ieee80211abg
  custom-command {1 11 3 1 1 2 11 10 11 2 10 10 10 10 10 10 9 9 9 10 10 11 4 11 4 4 11 11 10 2 9 9}
  config {...}
    }
    custom-config {
  custom-config-id ns2script
  custom-command {10 3 11 10 10 10 10 10}
  config {
  file=%%scen_path%%
  refresh_ms=50
  loop=1
  autostart=5.0
  map=
  script_start=
  script_pause=
  script_stop=
  }
    }
    canvas c1
    iconcoords {0.0 0.0}
    labelcoords {0.0 0.0}
    interface-peer {e0 n1}
    ...
}

Note the addition of an "ns2script" custom-config section, as well as the
addition of "ns2script" to the list of imported modules in the network-config
section.
